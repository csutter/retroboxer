# OS/2 Warp 4.52
## Setup
- There is a lot of switching between CDs involved for some reason
- The LVM tool when setting up disks is very unintuitive:
  - Ignore that the current selection seems to be the CD-ROM drive
  - Hit `Enter`, "Create a new volume", "... that can be made bootable", "C:"
  - Give it a reasonable name (e.g. `OSVOL`)
  - Follow the prompts from here until you you are done and asked to reboot (don't forget to switch
    back to the boot CD)
