# Windows 95
## Setup
- Boot from a Windows 95 boot floppy
  - Choose NEC IDE driver when prompted
  - Run `fdisk` and agree to large disk support
  - Create a primary DOS partition (option 1, followed by option 1 again, say "Y" to maximum space
    and making it active)
  - Exit and reboot
  - Run `format C:`
  - Give it a volume label, e.g. `WIN`
- Launch the Windows 95 installer
  - Run `D:\SETUP`
  - Work your way through the setup wizard, decline startup disk if prompted
  - Make sure to eject floppy disk before continuing on the reboot prompt
- Set up Windows 95 once booted in
  - Change desktop resolution and colour depth (e.g. 1024x768@16bit)
