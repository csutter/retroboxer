## Setup notes
- When first booting, the absence of BIOS memory will show an error - use this opportunity to get
  into the BIOS setup (Delete)
  - In "BIOS Features Setup", set boot sequence to `A,CDROM,C` (the default is `C,A` which will get
    you stuck after FDISK because it will try to boot from `C` with no time to enter BIOS setup
    before)
